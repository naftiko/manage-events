name: AI Context
description: |-
  This use case focuses on providing Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers on top of common private, public/1st party and 3rd party APIs, as well as local SQL databases, employing a domain-driven, declarative, and governed approach to right-sizing the context windows via MCP while providing integrations for us across AI copilots and agents. 

  Teams need a reliable way to deliver MCP servers from internal and third-party APIs without having to discover and learn about each API and the technical details of integration. This use case provides the fundamentals for safely integrating existing data and systems into artificial intelligence copilots and agents.

  - Add data and tools to agents
