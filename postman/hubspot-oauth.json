		"description": "HubSpot's OAuth 2.0 implementation provides secure authorization for applications \nto access HubSpot resources on behalf of users.\n\nHubSpot supports the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code grant type, which consists of:\n1. Directing users to HubSpot's authorization server\n2. Users reviewing and granting permissions\n3. Receiving an authorization code via redirect\n4. Exchanging the code for access and refresh tokens\n5. Using access tokens to make API calls\n6. Refreshing expired access tokens\n\n## Key Features\n- Access tokens expire after 30 minutes (1800 seconds)\n- Refresh tokens can be used to obtain new access tokens\n- Scopes define the level of access granted to your application\n- State parameter helps prevent CSRF attacks\n\n## Important Notes\n- The user installing the app must be a Super Admin\n- Access tokens reflect app scopes, not individual user permissions\n- HTTPS is required for production redirect URIs\n\n\nContact Support:\n Name: HubSpot Developer Support",
