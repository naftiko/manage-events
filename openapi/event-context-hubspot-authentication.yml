  title: HubSpot OAuth 2.0 API
  version: v1
  description: |
    HubSpot's OAuth 2.0 implementation provides secure authorization for applications 
    to access HubSpot resources on behalf of users.
    
    HubSpot supports the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code grant type, which consists of:
    1. Directing users to HubSpot's authorization server
    2. Users reviewing and granting permissions
    3. Receiving an authorization code via redirect
    4. Exchanging the code for access and refresh tokens
    5. Using access tokens to make API calls
    6. Refreshing expired access tokens
    
    ## Key Features
    - Access tokens expire after 30 minutes (1800 seconds)
    - Refresh tokens can be used to obtain new access tokens
    - Scopes define the level of access granted to your application
    - State parameter helps prevent CSRF attacks
    
    ## Important Notes
    - The user installing the app must be a Super Admin
    - Access tokens reflect app scopes, not individual user permissions
    - HTTPS is required for production redirect URIs

      summary: Authorization endpoint
      description: |
        Initiates the OAuth 2.0 authorization flow by directing the user to HubSpot's 
        authorization page. The user will review the requested permissions and either 
        grant or deny access to your application.
        
        This endpoint should be called by redirecting the user's browser to the 
        constructed URL with the required parameters.
        
        ## Flow
        1. Build authorization URL with required parameters
        2. Redirect user's browser to this endpoint
        3. User logs in (if needed) and reviews permissions
        4. User grants or denies access
        5. User is redirected to your redirect_uri with code or error
        
        ## Important
        - Users must have access to all requested scopes or installation will fail
        - Super Admin access is required to install apps
        - Use the state parameter to prevent CSRF attacks

        Exchange an authorization code for access and refresh tokens, or refresh 
        an expired access token using a refresh token.
        
        This endpoint supports two grant types:
        1. authorization_code: Exchange authorization code for tokens
        2. refresh_token: Exchange refresh token for new access token
        
        ## Access Token Lifecycle
        - Access tokens expire after 30 minutes (1800 seconds)
        - Use the refresh token to obtain a new access token
        - Each token exchange returns a new refresh token
        - Store tokens securely

x-hubspot-best-practices:
  - Store client_secret securely and never expose it in client-side code
  - Always validate the state parameter to prevent CSRF attacks
  - Implement token refresh before access tokens expire
  - Handle authorization errors gracefully
  - Request only the scopes your app actually needs
  - Use HTTPS for all redirect URIs in production
  - Store refresh tokens securely
  - Implement proper error handling for expired or invalid tokens
