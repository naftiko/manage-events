            A filter query string narrows search results and supports the
            combination of logical and comparison operators.

            The filter adheres to the pattern filter='field' comparisonType
            'value'.


            These are the comparison types that can be used in filter
            expressions:

            * equal: eq

            * includes value(s): in


            The following fields are filterable:

            * hidden (eq)

            * deleted (eq)

            * id (in)
          schema:
            type: string
            example: >-
              id in ('{UUID}', '{UUID}') AND deleted eq 'true' AND hidden eq
              'true'
